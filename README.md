# CleanroomLoggerSourceCode


[CleanroomLogger](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger) provides an extensible Swift-based logging API that is simple, lightweight and performant.

I collect the source code from [CleanroomLogger Release](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger/releases/tag/1.3.7) and [CleanroomASL release](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomASL/releases/tag/1.1.3). (for swift 1.2 only)

So it is easy to use in your project, just drag the directory to your project. And then, add `#import <asl.h>` to your project's bridge header. 

enjoy it.
